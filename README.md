# Day97-Manga-New-Chapter-Notifier
A simple email notifier for new manga chapters

This notifier triggers every time a new chapter of your favourite manga drops. 
This uses selenium to get data about any new chapters(using apis would be much faster and efficient).
This uses sqlalchemy as db so the user can add any amount of Manga they want and they'll be notified via email whenever a new chapter drops.
